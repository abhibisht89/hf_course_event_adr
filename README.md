we use the ðŸ¤— transformers library to fine-tune the SpanBERT/spanbert-large-cased model on the dataset ade_corpus_v2. The goal is for the fine-tuned model to perform Named Entity Recognition by identifying Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) as well as Drug names.

The finetune notebook for the ADR_XTRACTER model is contributed by https://github.com/jsylee, the original notebook which is used to finetune SciBERT can be find at :
